# Product Vision — EventFlow

## Overview

EventFlow is an automation platform that enables users to connect systems and processes through **event-based workflows**.

Inspired by tools like Zapier, EventFlow allows users to define automations that react to events and execute actions across different systems. The platform focuses on **clarity, extensibility, and observability**, providing a realistic environment for exploring how automation products evolve over time.

EventFlow is built as a long-term personal learning project, with the goal of practicing product thinking and system design in a real-world inspired context.

---

## Problem Statement

Many systems rely on tightly coupled integrations and manual workflows, making it difficult to react to changes or extend behavior without significant effort.

Common challenges include:
- Manual or repetitive processes
- Rigid point-to-point integrations
- Limited visibility into workflow execution
- Difficulty evolving systems as new needs emerge

EventFlow addresses these challenges by enabling **event-driven automations**, where systems emit events and workflows react to them in a flexible and observable way.

---

## Product Goals

The primary goals of EventFlow are to:

- Enable users to define automations based on events
- Support multiple systems interacting through the platform
- Allow workflows to evolve without tight coupling
- Provide visibility into automation execution
- Serve as a practical environment for studying automation platforms

---

## What EventFlow Is

EventFlow is:
- An automation platform inspired by event-driven workflows
- A system that connects multiple components and services
- A product that evolves incrementally over time
- A learning-oriented project focused on architectural exploration

---

## What EventFlow Is Not

EventFlow is not:
- A production-ready commercial platform
- A full replacement for existing automation tools
- A low-latency orchestration engine
- An interview coding challenge or take-home assignment

---

## Core Product Capabilities

At a high level, EventFlow enables users to:

- Register and manage event sources
- Define automations triggered by events
- Configure actions executed as part of an automation
- Monitor automation executions and outcomes
- Inspect historical execution data for observability and learning

These capabilities are intentionally broad to allow the platform to grow in complexity as the system evolves.

---

## Automation Concept

An automation in EventFlow represents a **reaction to an event**.

An automation typically consists of:
- One or more triggering events
- Optional conditions
- One or more actions to be executed

Automations are designed to be reusable, extensible, and observable.

---

## User Experience

EventFlow provides a web-based interface where users can:
- Explore available events
- Create and manage automations
- Enable or disable workflows
- Inspect execution history and logs

The user experience prioritizes **understanding system behavior** over advanced UI interactions.

---

## Target Users

EventFlow is designed for:
- Engineers interested in automation platforms
- Technical users exploring event-driven concepts
- Individuals experimenting with system integration patterns

The platform prioritizes technical clarity over mass-market usability.

---

## Scope & Evolution

EventFlow is intentionally scoped to be:

- **Large enough** to support multiple services and workflows
- **Small enough** to remain manageable by a single engineer

The platform is expected to evolve gradually, with features added as part of architectural and product exploration rather than feature completeness.

---

## Success Criteria

EventFlow is considered successful if it:

- Clearly demonstrates the core concepts of automation platforms
- Supports multiple interacting components
- Enables realistic workflow scenarios
- Provides clear visibility into automation behavior
- Documents product and system evolution over time

---

## Long-Term Vision

Over time, EventFlow may evolve to include:
- Additional automation capabilities
- More complex workflows and conditions
- Enhanced observability features
- Experimental extensions for learning purposes

Feature growth remains secondary to maintaining a clear and well-reasoned product vision.

---

## Summary

EventFlow is a Zapier-inspired automation platform focused on **event-based workflows**, designed as a long-term learning and system design exploration.

The project emphasizes product clarity, realistic scope, and thoughtful evolution rather than feature breadth or production readiness.
