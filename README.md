# EventFlow — Architecture & Documentation Hub

This repository serves as the **central documentation hub** for the EventFlow initiative.

EventFlow is a long-term, personal engineering project focused on exploring **event-driven architectures, microservices, and distributed system design** through the evolution of a realistic automation platform.

This repository intentionally contains **no production code**.

Instead, it captures:
- Product thinking
- Architectural decisions
- Technical assessments
- Design trade-offs
- System evolution over time

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to document **how and why** architectural decisions are made before and during implementation.

It acts as:
- A living architecture notebook
- A decision log (ADRs)
- A product and system design reference
- The source of truth for all EventFlow-related design artifacts

---

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

Most software projects showcase *what* was built.

EventFlow focuses on:
- **Why** certain decisions were made
- **What alternatives were considered**
- **How trade-offs were evaluated**

This mirrors the way complex systems are designed and evolved in mature engineering organizations.

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This repository contains:
- Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Architecture diagrams and system overviews
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Technical Assessments (TAs)
- Request for Comments (RFCs)
- Roadmaps and evolution notes

---

## 🔗 Related Repositories

As the system evolves, implementation repositories will be created, each focused on a specific bounded context or service, for example:

- `event-flow-ingestion`
- `event-flow-automation`
- `event-flow-execution`
- `event-flow-notification`

Each implementation repository references this hub as its architectural source of truth.

---

## 🚧 Status

EventFlow is an **ongoing personal learning project**.

Documentation is expected to evolve alongside the system as new insights, trade-offs, and constraints emerge.

---

## 📎 Disclaimer

EventFlow is a personal educational initiative and is not affiliated with any commercial automation platforms.
